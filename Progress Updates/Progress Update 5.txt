This update, I struggled quite a bit with the Screen.Tracer() function. I didn't release it was what was causing the issue, but my code execution would just stop after a certain point (only for turtle, not for print statements) and it was quite puzzling. After just messing around, I found that removing the tracer function fixed it, but also that you were required to turn the tracer back to true eventually later on.
